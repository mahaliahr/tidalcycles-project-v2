Building my skills and working out what kind of (live code / algorithmically-based) musician I am.

One 'track' per month.

**Leftover ideas from last year:**
AI_I_CU / Computational Other - finish it properly ?

Ethereal Break(House)

Sample myself playing the horn

Play around more with randomness
explore using custom functions

**New Random Ideas**

Traffic Jam sounds

**Possible Constraints:**

1. Single Sound Source: Create an entire track using variations of a single sound or sample.

2. Silence as an Element: Intentionally incorporate periods of silence within your track, using them as rhythmic or dramatic elements.

3. Monophonic Composition: Use only one note at a time throughout the track, avoiding chords and harmonies.

4. Reverse Sounds: Utilise backward sounds or melodies to create a unique texture.

5. No Percussion: Build a track without any traditional percussive elements, focusing on melody and harmony.

6. Ambient Only: Create a track that is entirely ambient, focusing on mood and atmosphere rather than rhythm and melody.

7. Fixed BPM: Stick to a predetermined beats-per-minute (BPM) that you don't usually work with.

8. Imposed Narrative: Base your track on a pre-written story or poem, translating the narrative or emotions into music.

9. Harmonic Constraints: Limit yourself to a specific chord progression or a set of chords for the entire piece.

10. Field Recordings: Incorporate field recordings, whether natural sounds, cityscapes, or household noises.

11. Human Voice Only: Use only the human voice (yours or samples) as the sound source for your track.

12. Algorithmic Rules: Set up specific rules or algorithms for your composition process, like a set order for introducing and removing elements.

13. Remix Challenge: Take one of your older tracks and remix it under a new constraint.

14. Spatial Constraints: Experiment with the stereo field, perhaps confining sounds to only left, right, or centre channels.

15. Texture Focus: Focus on creating a track with a specific texture, like smooth, gritty, or granular sounds.
