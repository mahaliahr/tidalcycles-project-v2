# tidalcycles-project-v2

Building my skills and working out what kind of (live code / algorithmically-based) musician I am.

One 'track' per month.



(the 'tracks' may be chaotic)

---

|Month| Theme|Recording|
| --- | --- | --- |
|January|Remixing a 2020 track because I ran out of time...| <https://youtu.be/hOqeGyfNjQo> |
|February|don't love what I made this month, but some nice bits that I'll probably revisit| <https://youtu.be/H-4Rnx6h_gI>|
|March|developed the feb track into something I like more, though I still feel like I might do more with it|<https://on.soundcloud.com/ve29ntMa77KKxYJ46>|

**Leftover ideas from last year:**
AI_I_CU / Computational Other - finish it properly ?

Ethereal Break(House)

Sample myself playing the horn

Play around more with randomness
explore using custom functions

**New Random Ideas**

Traffic Jam sounds

**Possible Constraints:**

Single Sound Source: Create an entire track using variations of a single sound or sample.

Monophonic Composition: Use only one note at a time throughout the track, avoiding chords and harmonies.

Reverse Sounds: Utilise backward sounds or melodies to create a unique texture.

No Percussion: Build a track without any traditional percussive elements, focusing on melody and harmony.

Ambient Only: Create a track that is entirely ambient, focusing on mood and atmosphere rather than rhythm and melody.

Fixed BPM: Stick to a predetermined beats-per-minute (BPM) that you don't usually work with.

Imposed Narrative: Base your track on a pre-written story or poem, translating the narrative or emotions into music.

Harmonic Constraints: Limit yourself to a specific chord progression or a set of chords for the entire piece.

Field Recordings: Incorporate field recordings, whether natural sounds, cityscapes, or household noises.

Human Voice Only: Use only the human voice (yours or samples) as the sound source for your track.

Remix Challenge: Take one of your older tracks and remix it under a new constraint (did for January)

Spatial Constraints: Experiment with the stereo field, perhaps confining sounds to only left, right, or centre channels.

Texture Focus: Focus on creating a track with a specific texture, like smooth, gritty, or granular sounds.
